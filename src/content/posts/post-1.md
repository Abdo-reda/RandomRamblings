Oh hi there! you are probably lost. But you are welcome to stay a while. You might be wondering what this is all about! Guess what? I am too. So lets talk and figure this out. Although I will be doing most of the talking.

First things first, lets get this out of the way. I am not a good or witty writer. And I can't promise you the reader anything really. What I can promise, is that this blog will be ME, **a lot of ME**. So be prepared for that (highly doubt anyone can be prepared). 

I am writing for myself and my sake, this is the highest priority. While this may sound very selfish, I thinks its very fair for a blog.

**But**, Even if I am not writing to anyone, I need to be clear with myself, and I have certain standards that I hold myself to. The main purpose, is to <span class="highlight"> write daily, about something I learnt </span>. Sounds simple enough? Can't be that difficult? right? I am hoping this will make me a better explainer/communicator, it will also make sure that I understood what I learnt. 

So, **lets start with today**. did I learn anything today? umm ... I don't think so really ... but I did have a very nice conversation with a friend. So, I guess I will write about that for today.

I felt good about the conversation because I felt very well understood. I didn't need an additional layer of translation. I struggle a lot with self-worth and meaningfulness. I have a  <span class="highlight"> terrible negative voice </span>, and I am well aware of that. I am not a believer of figuring out why this is the case, maybe its my parents, maybe its the enviornment I grew in. But lets be real, its probably my parents. Regardless, I don't think it matters.

What matters, is how I deal with it NOW. And to be honest, I have been random. Mostly I give in, believe everything that the voice has to say. Usually, I try to keep myself busy. I don't need to worry about dealing with my negative voice, because I won't give myself time to be negative. 

Well, these are probably not very solid approaches. A valid approach, **is probably to talk to someone**. If you are like me, and you don't have anyone to talk to comfortably, or you don't want to talk or annyone anyone. Then, you need to be that someone. Its probably easier said than done, but it gets better with practice like anything else. The key I believe, is **communication with yourself**. I think, you need to ask yourself a lot of question, and pretend your having an actual converstaion. Don't skim or skip the converstation, because you already know what you will say or think will say. SAY IT OUTLOUD OR WRITE IT. Hearing it, makes a difference.

I will keep today short ... I think that was short anyway, hopefully tomorrow, we delve into more technical stuff.
